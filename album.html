    <h1 class="what">What is my Favorite Album?</h1>
    <p>My favorite Album is probably <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_of_Pablo" target="_blank">"The Life Of Pablo"</a></b>.<br>Its my favorite album because its one of those albums<br> that you listen to the whole way. The first time i listened to it <br> i remember loving every single song in the album. Although <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West">Kanye West</a> is a person of contraversy i really enjoy his music.</p>

    <h1 class="why">Why is it my Favorite Album?</h1>
    <p>The life of pablo is my favorite album because i really<br> enjoy the sound and lyrics, I think they match perfectly. Like<br> I said in the first paragraph that its one of those<br> albums that I love from begining to end. Mostly what<br>I like about the music he made in this album<br> is that it makes me feel this energy in the morning<br> when I went to school or work.</p>

    <h1 class="see">Why you should hear it?</h1>
    <p>I think you should listen to Kanye West's album The Life Of Pablo<br> because, he may be a very confusing person to understand but his music <br> makes people like him. His music expresses how he percieves things <br> and i relate to some of his music but overall this album is my favorite from most <br> of his music.</p>
