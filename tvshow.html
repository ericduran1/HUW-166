    <h1 class="what">What is my Favorite Tv Show?</h1>
    <p>My favorite Show is probably<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcos" target="_blank">"Narcos"</a></b>. Narco's is a Netflix original <br> that is an action drama show about colombia's top drug smugglers bringing<br> about the rise of the most massive drug empire of its time. The show is really<br> good and well shot and gives me a very vivid picture of how violent<br> and lucrative that life can be. <br> </p>

    <h1 class="why">Why is it my Favorite Show?</h1>
    <p>Its my favorite show because the show really shows how powerful the<br> enemy is in a time where technology was only just starting to enter the world.<br> I love how they make the enemy look like gods because it make's<br> the show more interesting, showing all the power these people had.<br> I also like that they were able to make a show about the past so well written<br> because after this show a bunch of people tried to mimic the show<br> but the knockoffs couldnt captivate me, not like the writters of the original one. </p>

    <h1 class="see">Why you should see it?</h1>
    <p>I think you should see the show Narcos because its a good Netflix original,<br> and because season 4 is coming out on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/06/netflix-narcos-mexico-premieres-november-16th/">November 16 , 2018</a>. The show has<br> a lot of action but suprisingly not so much blood at first. Theres scenese where<br> they show killing but its not like other shows that show alot. There is some scenes that<br> can be a little much but its not super insanely gorey. I definitely recommend this<br> show because its just a well written show.  </p>
